<h1 id="title1">第3罪：没有Touch ID</h1>

<p id="p1">
在iPhone13系列发布前，网上就曾爆出iPhone13Pro会新增屏下指纹解锁功能，但如今发布后才知道，新机虽然可以带着口罩实现人脸解锁，但Touch ID其实更加实用。传闻是Touch ID在金融支付等功能上，屏下指纹解锁精准度还没有达标，所以苹果暂时不考虑。难道是苹果专注于市场营销，而缺乏研发能力吗？

<p id="p2">
I like for you to be still,it is as though you were absent,and you hear me from far away,and my voice does not touch you.It seems as though your eyes had flown awayand it seems that a kiss had sealed your mouth.As all things are filled with my soulyou emerge from the things,filled my soul.You are like my soul,a butterfly of dream,and you are like the word Melancholy.I like for you to be still,and you seem far away.It sounds as though you were lamenting,a butterfly cooinglike a dove.And you hear me from far away and my voice does not rouch you:Let me come to be still in your silence.And let me talk to you with your silencethat is brightas a lamp,simple as a ring.You are like the night,with it's stillness and constellations.Your silence is that of a star,as remore and candid.I like for you to be still,it is as though you were absent,distant anf fullof sorrow as though you had died.One word then,one smile,is enough.And I am happy,happy that it's not true.
